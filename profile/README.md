## ​ What is Meshtastic Web Flasher?

**Meshtastic Web Flasher** is the official browser-based tool for flashing firmware to Meshtastic nodes — these are LoRa mesh networking devices powered by IoT-friendly ESP32 microcontrollers. The web flasher removes barriers such as driver installation or Python scripting by letting you update your device right from **Chrome or Edge** using the **Web Serial API**.

Built with **Nuxt.js**, **Vue**, and **Tailwind CSS**, the flashing tool is part of the Meshtastic ecosystem and GitHub-driven workflow. It directly integrates **esptool-js** for flashing logic, offering a familiar yet powerful experience.

Key features include:

- Flash Meshtastic firmware (including UI packages like Meshtastic UI)  
- Two modes: update or clean install (“Wipe & Install”)  
- Built-in **Serial Monitor** for debugging and log inspection  
- No drivers required on most OS — it works easily on both desktop and laptop  
- Works on devices such as ESP32-based LoRa boards (e.g., T-Deck, SenseCAP, Meshstick)  
- Fully open-source under **GPL-3.0** license  
- Actively maintained with over 175 stars and 68 forks on GitHub :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
